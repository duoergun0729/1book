vance ,
it appears the actual volumes have been significantly higher than nominations
at the subject meter the past several months . the following represents
activity during the months of june through september :
gas month total nom mmbtu total actual mmbtu
06 / 2000 19 , 680 116 , 040
07 / 2000 19 , 933 128 , 755
08 / 2000 19 , 530 136 , 845
09 / 2000 18 , 540 159 , 935
deal # 135708 , calpine natural gas company , is the only activity at this
meter . should we adjust the nomination to more closely resemble the actual
volume ? please advise . thanks .
bob
