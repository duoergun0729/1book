we have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to
analyze the producer services portion of the p & l . to do this , we have been
looking at daily volumes on the 96026572 contract . pops shows a daily bav of
approximately 612 , 000 . mops shows a daily bav of approximately 601 , 000 . i
wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you . by the way ,
it also looks like the noms for the gathering contract are a lot higher ,
