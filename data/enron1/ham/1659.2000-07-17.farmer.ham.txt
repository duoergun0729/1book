subject : hourly gas deals
here is a high level summary of our discussions last week . i believe that
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how hpl would like to
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis .
option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis .
bob : please review with the other trading directors and see if they also
prefer to see everything on a 24 hour flow rate basis . thanks ! - tommy
