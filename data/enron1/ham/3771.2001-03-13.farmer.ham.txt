Subject: tenaska iv 1 / 01
we need to change the demand fees for tenaska iv based on actuals for jan 2001 . tenaska owes us some additional money . i have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it .
deal 514353 change mmbtu from 45 , 000 to 46 , 113
deal 384258 change amount from $ 3 , 934 , 644 . 50 to $ 3 , 841 , 888 . 11
i got your message regarding apache . i will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it . also , mark checked with txu and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the tenaska meters . he said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies . for the spreadsheet , i am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms .
i will let you know when we receive the payment from brazos for feb 2001 , so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to tenaska iv .
thanks ,
megan
