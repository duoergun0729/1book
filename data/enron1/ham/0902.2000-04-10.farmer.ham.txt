Subject: re : coastal deal - with exxon participation under the project
agreement
thanks for the info !
as greg mentioned in the staff meeting today , the intent is that this
restructured deal is papered effective 4 / 1 / 00 . the impact is potentially
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate
transport / gathering agreements , etc . if any rates are changing , then those
need to be changed in our systems also . there may be other areas of changes
also - i ' m not attempting to list them all . rather i just want to make
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations .
thanks for the information .
pat / daren : can you get with mike and / or brian to determine the potential
impact , if any ? thanks .

subject : coastal deal - with exxon participation under the project agreement
brenda ,
per your request , attached are the draft documents which will be used to
finalize the new gathering arrangment between hpl and coastal , the revenue
sharing arrangement between exxon and hpl ( transaction agreement ) and the
residue gas purchase agreement between coastal , as seller and hpl as buyer
( amendment to wellhead purchase agreeement ) .
i do not have a copy of the processing agreement between exxon and coastal ,
as such agreement does not involve us ( and i believe it is far from
finalized . the only other document that i plan to prepare is a termination
agreement relative to the current liquifiables purchase agreement between
exxon as purchaser and hpl as seller - - this termination will be affective as
of 4 / 1 / 2000 .
if i can be of any further assistance , please let me know .
steve
