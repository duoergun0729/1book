bob ,
go ahead and accept the nom revision . i believe that this is with pge , not
el paso . how do the rest of our noms compare with eog ? i f they have a
higher volume at another meter than we do , i would like to increase our nom
there . in effect , i want to keep our physical index position as close as
possible to what we have in the system now .
