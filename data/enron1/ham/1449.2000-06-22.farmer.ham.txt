Subject: devon - effective july 1 , 2000
effective julyl , 2000 , i will be the new point of contact at enron north
america for devon . in an effort to
avoid duplication of e - mails to every scheduler on every desk , i would like
to forward the volumes , revisions
or any other pertinent information to only the people who need it . could
you please send me a list of the schedulers
who handle devon on each of your desks and the pipes they schedule ? i will
also forward a copy of any changes to
a point person on each desk that will follow up with the schedulers to make
sure they make appropriate revisions .
if you have any suggestions on how to streamline this process any further ,
please let me know .
thanks ,
bev beaty
