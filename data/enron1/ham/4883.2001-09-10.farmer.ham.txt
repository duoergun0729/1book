daren , i wanted to check with you on the current status of the of txu pipeline imbalance for tenaska iv . i noticed on the july statement i just received that the imbalance was at 125 , 374 mmbtu . i am not sure if you have been told , but enron recently entered into a sale agreement with el paso to sale our interests in this plant by the end of september . talking with rick hill , he did not want to have a large imbalance liability with the pipeline at the end of september . do you think this imbalance will be significantly resolved by the end of the month ? you can call me at 3 - 7280 if you have any questions . thanks .
