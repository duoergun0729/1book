lee ,
i did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu / day of
fuel
gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas . we will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days .
