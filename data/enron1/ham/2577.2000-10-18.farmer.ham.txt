ami ,
i think you ' re referring to the 28 th . on the 15 th we reported 30 at the hpl
ls
katy i . c . below is a copy of the note you originally sent me back on
10 / 05 / 00 .
i called gary gafford , but only got through to his voice mail . i requested he
call me tomorrow to clear this up . unless i hear otherwise , i will proceed
for
a correction on march 28 th , not march 15 th .
thanks ,
ccs
charlie ,
here is a breakout for the volumes that have been paid on . we are off by
approximately 20000 according to what was billed vs what was paid . could
you peruse the worksheet for discrepancies . we are off by 20 , 000 in march
( 28 th ) . our logs show that 20000 flowed on that day at ls ( meter 67 ) . i ' ve
attached the email showing the revision for that day below . based on paid
amounts , the remaining obligations are as follows :
iferc 2 , 680 , 000
iferc + gas daily 6 , 895 , 252
please advise .
regards ,
ami
