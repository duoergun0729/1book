lee ,
our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest .
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
fuel . we are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu / d knowing that we should start
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .
