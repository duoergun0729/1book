revision - according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however ,
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of 7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ? i checked
oss for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in oss . it does
seem strange that this is the only month of flow .
thanks , stella
