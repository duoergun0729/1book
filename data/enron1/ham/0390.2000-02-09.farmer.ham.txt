subject : re : entex volumes
ami ,
sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of
implementing sap ( which i ' m sure
you have heard about ) , and haven ' t had time to put the sample report
together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he
will be getting back with you on this .
