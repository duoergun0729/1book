Subject: falcon / lone star transport
darren ,
i joined brian redmond on his visit a few weeks ago to sid richardson . during that visit sr indicated that they have firm lone star transport that they want to sell ( only details i know at this time is that it is 45 mm / d point to point on a true firm basis ) . i believe we could use this transport to back stop the falcon transaction ( parking gas in their facility oct / nov 01 - jan 04 ) . i spoke with the folks at sr today and indicated that we want to know more details about the sale to see if we could garner interest internally . they gave me the name of a person in their shop who would be right person to talk to about the details . i understand you would be the right person to a ) . bounce this idea off of and b ) . if there is an interest on this transport i presume you would be the best person to get the details on this transport from sr .
the name of the person to talk to at sr is scott walker ( 817 . 810 . 9385 ) .
i ' d like to touch base with about this .
thanks
