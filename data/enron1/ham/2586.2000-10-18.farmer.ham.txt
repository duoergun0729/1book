paul , please pass this on to anyone who would need to know . beginning
september 00 and continuing for one year , ena is buying production tied
directly
into entex ' s pipeline system . the company we are purchasing from is osborne
oil and we are selling directly to entex under the big contract at if plus
+ . 769 .
this meter will be allocated by a third party and the meter statement will be
sent to us and entex . we will bill & pay off of the meter statement ( if this
is not possible or reasonable , let me know ) . see attached pricing for
osborne .
i would like the person whom is paying osbourne to contact me .
thanks ,
