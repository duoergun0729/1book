daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the 26 th . it was
edi ' d over to pops from the 25 th through the 31 st populating all days with
the 16 , 700 nom . the nom was never - 0 - out in pops therefore the change
notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter . this
meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this
was missed in mops . the record would have been out of balance and someone ,
if not several people , normally would make a comment on this . also - all
of my records indicate that the 16 , 700 was good through the 31 st except the
mops entry . my confirmations with koch didn ' t reflect the - 0 - ; the last
report i have from koch indicated the 16 , 700 stayed on , there was no record
of a phone call indicating anything other than 16 , 700 . it is very odd for
this many checks and balances to fail . also , the volumes were being sent
back to mops which no one caught .
i have spoken with koch today and they agree that the 16 , 700 should have gone
to - 0 - therefore i have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and
re - allocated the meter . the oba has taken the hit and i am working off the
imbalance now .
daren , i am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my
responsibility . stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors
because i was buried in current activity , thus the e - mail to you asking for
your help .
if this doesn ' t answer all the questions , just give me a call .
thanks ,
charlotte

stella and charlotte ,
i looked into this deal . we sold this gas for one day only . in mops , the
path was nominated for 1 / 26 only . however , in pops the path was nominated
and confirmed for 1 / 26 - 1 / 31 . this should have been showing up as a
bridgeback error during the month . also , someone should have identified that
the path / nom in mops wasn ' t the same as the nom in pops . this discrepancy
should have been found before we closed out january .
i researched this problem by reviewing both systems ( looking at the path id
in pops , finding it in mops , and checking the audit on the path in mops ) .
this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group ,
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem . the resolution , not the
problem , should have been presented to myself or the marketer , with an
explanation of what happened . some one still needs to find out how the gas
was confirmed for the 27 th - 31 st .
since the gas apparently flowed , we will have to apply the overflow to the
oba . unless you can find a missing transport contract .

joanie ,
logistics is waiting to hear from daren on this issue . he will either need
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place . this
deal 155118 is valid on 1 / 26 / 00 only , but the rest of the volume you are
looking for is scheduled on days 1 / 27 - 1 / 31 . i am sure there is no
pricing on those days .
i will let you know as soon as i hear from them .
