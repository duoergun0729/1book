Subject: resumes sent
i sent you a stack of risk candidate resumes inter - office monday . ( steve ,
dutch also received them - spoke with him directly ) . these candidates
have not been contacted . please let me know who looks good for your
positions to help prioritize the ones we should phone screen .
i also have a stack of out of town resumes that would probably need
relocation . let me know if you want to see them .
