nick ,
i am not sure what happened to this volume . i cannot tell by the audit
trail , but there is a connection between meter hpl meter 987283 , and midt
989807 . the volume you are referring to is on mid - tex pipeline under meter
989807 . it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference . i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl . get with thu when she returns to see if she
knows anything about this .
