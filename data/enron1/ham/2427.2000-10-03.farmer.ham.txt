daren , there are five hplc purchase deals for 09 / 99 from ocean energy inc .
they were craig falbaum ' s deals . a person who is no longer in my group
suspended payment for these deals . gary suggested that i contact you and see
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended , or
know anything that might help . thanks .
