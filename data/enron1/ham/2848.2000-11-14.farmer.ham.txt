ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .
please call with questions .
thanks
