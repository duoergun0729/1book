subject : vacation
bh ,
i plan to be on vacation july 5 - 6 ( finally ) and on the customer trip on the
7 th . while i am out , gary hanks will be keeping our position during
trading . stacey will be in charge of everything else . i am comfortable that
everything will be covered .
i will be back in town thursday night . the primary flight for the customer
trip leaves around 11 : 30 . others leave at 3 : 30 and 5 : 30 ( ? ) . the latest
idea we had is that pat would take a later flight on this trip and i will
take a later flight on the august trip , allowing one of us to be in the
office for half the day . i can also come in for the half day on the 7 th if
we decide that is needed .
