megan ,
the april and may nomination spreadsheets from producer services reflect that there were purchases from conoco on hpl . there are no references to any purchases from conoco on gepl . on june 6 , 2001 , tom acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include gepl meter # ' s 27 - 002 - 08 and 27 - 003 - 08 . i have no idea why tom edited the deal ticket to include the gepl meters . tom is no longer at aep and i couldn ' t find any documentation to support the changes . please advise if you need additional information .
