i did not know that this was part of a natural gas / crude oil exchange deal
and billed texas general land office for the gas sale in jan . 01
do you have a crude oil payable to offset this sales invoice ?
if so , will this a / r balance of $ 974 , 144 . 00 be netted against the crude oil
payable in sap ?
please let me know , i would like to take care of the net in sap asap .
thanks - katherine
