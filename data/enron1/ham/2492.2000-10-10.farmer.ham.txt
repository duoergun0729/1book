daren :
i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

read information below and see if this helps one of the unresolved problems
for august .
megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for august 1 ? i do not
know why august 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the fuel cotton valley gas . this is
priced at hsc daily - . 10 per paragraph 3 of the contract . if a different
price was worked out with darren , i do not have record of it . darren is
out until next week .
