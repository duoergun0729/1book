darren ,
how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .
john
