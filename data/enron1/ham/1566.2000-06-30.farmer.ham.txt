bob ,
hplc will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producer listed below for the
production month of july . this production will be purchased on a " spot "
basis and a deal ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on
the following information :
counterparty meter volume price
cody texas , l . p . 5333 2975 mmbtu / d 100 % if / hsc less $ 0 . 09
this ticket should be marked evergreen , so that it rolls month to month .
additionally , this is a producer svcs . deals and should be tracked in the im
wellhead portfolio . . . attached to the gathering contract .
hillary ,
i noticed deal 305549 has just been put in for one day ( 6 / 1 / 00 ) . we have
flow at this meter during the month of june , so could this ticket be changed
to go through 6 / 30 / 00 ?
