this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .
thanks
