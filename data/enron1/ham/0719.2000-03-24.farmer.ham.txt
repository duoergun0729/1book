Subject: williams energy marketing
i have a request from the ena settlements group . williams energy is billing
the hpl purchase deals on the ena invoice . the accountant at williams says ,
that by the request of the hpl trader , the deals are to be billed to ena . we
would like to have the texas deals billed directly to hpl . if you do not
have a problem with this , can you ask your counterpart at williams to split
the deals between hpl and ena ? it would make the payment process much easier .
thanks ,
megan
