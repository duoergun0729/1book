Subject: re : meter 6879 - sept . 00
this deal was not put in right . the primary term of the contract goes out to
9 / 30 / 00 . there is no evergreen to the contract . the deal will end when the
contract ends . therefore , i have taken the evergreen off , and added
september to it .
if you have any questions , let me know .
