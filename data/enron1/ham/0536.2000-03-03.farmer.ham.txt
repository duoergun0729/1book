Subject: re : 3 - rivers / king ranch / hplr liquids
i have identified the additional hplc wellhead purchases and have made
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly . jackie is still having
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase . we feel there are at least
6 meters flowing a total of appox . 7000 a day that are not showing up on a
hplc purchase or a hplr transport . i believe she has given you this
information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input
reflecting the proper enron entity purchasing these volumes .
we have worked very hard on this issue and i apologize that it has not yet
been entirely corrected .
