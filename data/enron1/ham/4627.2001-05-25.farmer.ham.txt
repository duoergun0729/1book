Subject: lufkin
on may 27 th a lufkin industrial market will go down by 5 , 000 . we are going to move this sale to lyondell meter # 5045 . the sales price will remain at index minus $ . 12 . the sale will remain at lyondell for approximately 2 weeks . since the screen has fallen about $ 1 this should be a good thing for us and a very nice thing for entex to do for us .
thanks ,
