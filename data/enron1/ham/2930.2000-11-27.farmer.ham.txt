Subject: re : ces - devon
rita ,
since this is the case , i think we need to change the way we are booking this
deal . currently , the ces - devon purchase is on 8348 , which is a dummy inlet
to the plant . rather , we should probably just have the ena purch at the
tailgate , 986363 , with a d 2 d ticket that transfers ownership to hpl , if
necessary . please let me know what you think .
