i am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details . here are
my questions :
1 ) why was this gas just discovered now ? and where has it been hiding ?
2 ) adonis is a wmbe which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays
for gas taken . we have to invoice
the actual burner for this gas ( hl & p , tu , cp & l , etc ) . can we identify end
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay .
3 ) adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business . hl & p told me he
got paid for gas that never was delivered ( rumor ) .
how can we invoice him now ?
4 ) 60 , 000 mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks
for almost two years . answer the above questions and
i will be glad to approve this .

karen ,
i realize this . it appears as if you ' re asking me to have day 16 added to
the sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can
allocate to this deal .
maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case .

karen ,
i ' ve looked in pops and on day 16 of january 1999 , i see a total confirmed
volume of 61 , 365 and an actual of 62 , 151 . if i ' m understanding you
correctly , you ' re asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal # 51862 .
if so , that ' s incorrect . several deals are associated the this days volume .
please write back or phone back with further details .
thanks

the deal does not have this day on it . please have 1 / 16 added to the deal so
the error will clear .
