i received a call from carl drachenberg with hms at approximately 1 : 45 pm on
6 / 13 / 00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter # 986315 and it was wet and
flowing at 35 lb . i asked gary hanks what we want to do and he said to have
carl notify the producer and shut it in . i notified carl and he got in
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx . 2 pm on
6 / 13 and at that time there wasn ' t any flow . carl came back out there at 8
am on 6 / 14 and closed the valve and removed the chart . there was no flow
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf .
the meter is now out of service .
any questions - you know where to find me .
