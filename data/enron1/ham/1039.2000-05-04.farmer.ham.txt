the crow o ' connor , meter 6757 has its gas allocated to strangers gas for
april and may 1999 and duke has been calling settlements asking for their
money . i will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for
these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and
valid deal # for this transaction .
