i received a fax from you today regarding the keystone plant tailgate
volumes for march . i was
wondering if you forward this via e - mail as well . i don ' t always receive
faxes on a timely basis and i ' m
not sure the appropriate scheduler always receives the information . please
let me know .
thanks ,
beverly
