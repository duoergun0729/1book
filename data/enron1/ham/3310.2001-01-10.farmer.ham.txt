daren - after checking with mips , you are correct . jan . 1 only flowed 19
dth . the 5882 dth was a bad estimate . a better estimate was received on
1 / 7 / 00 .
sorry about all the confusion .

phillips said we shorted them gas on december lst so they pulled it on
january 1 . can we verify that we did not deliver 5 , 00 on dec . 1 ? if that is
the case and this was a firm sale , we owe him some gas at dec index less
( . 045 ) . which is bad ! let me know what happened in dec before i can put
this deal out in jan .

1 . this is a valid flow . could you please extend the deal from dec . ( deal #
