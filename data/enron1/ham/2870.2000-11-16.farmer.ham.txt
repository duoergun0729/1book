subject : re : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
please take note of dave ' s very important message regarding sitara
positions . we absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to
do everything possible to help limit the exposure . with prices where they
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging
bid week .
that being said i want each of you to make sure we adhere to the " daily
clean " process . you should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date . if you wish , donna and
richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group . we
don ' t have much time so this needs to happen immediately .
donna , please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the
remainder of the month .
let me know if you have any questions or concerns , thanks - bob

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data " cleaned / scrubbed " week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months " active " at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .
thanks , d . n .
