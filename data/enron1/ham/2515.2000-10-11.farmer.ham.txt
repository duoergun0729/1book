bob ,
you are correct , i did request a ticket at meter 5848 as a spot purchase .
however , i ' m not sure why the ticket was created in the name of coastal ; it
should have been in the name engage energy us , lp . as for october , hplc is
buying this package of gas on a " spot " basis and a ticket should be created
and entered in to sitara .
thanks ,
