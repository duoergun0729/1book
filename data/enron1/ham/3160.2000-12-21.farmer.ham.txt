Subject: work assignments
mike
i see that you have alot of the things that are on the error report , some of
which i am not sure that i have assigned to you . if anyone tells you that
you are now doing something off of their desk , please refer them to me at
this time . i don ' t want anyone to dump any the " crap " , or less savory work
off of t heir desks onto you ( we all have things we would prefer not to have
to do which still must be done , it just comes with the territory ) . also , let
me know if you feel comfortable with any additional shipper accounts . i
would like to see you crosstrain with sabrae after the holidays .
thanks ,
mary
