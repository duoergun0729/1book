george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and
samson lone star , 012 - 77555 - 105 , 96016761 .
let me know if there is further information that i can provide .
thank you ,
melissa
