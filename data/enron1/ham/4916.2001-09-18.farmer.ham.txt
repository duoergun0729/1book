Subject: natural gas
our ceo was contacted by a david gardner , president of gardner energy in
houston regarding a five - year package of gas . i spoke to him only briefly
but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal . do you know of this
firm ? i was unable to pull up anything on the internet . i suspect he ' s
just a marketer .
don ' t spend any time on this . i was just curious as to whether or not you
know of him or his firm . thanks .
