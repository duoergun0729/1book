tom ,
the following production commenced to flow on last week and a ticket should
be created and entered into sitara based on the following :
counterparty meter volumes price period
texas nom , lp ( dba
garrison , ltd . ) 9656 500 mmbtu / d 100 % gd less $ 0 . 10 3 / 27 - 3 / 31
susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the
reserves of this well ; at such time , this ticket should be zeroed out .
thanks ,
