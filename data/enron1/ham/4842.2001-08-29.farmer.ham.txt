Subject: month end close schedule * revised *
changes are in blue .
last month there was some confusion from several schedulers i spoke to about when changes could be made to ( august ) after the cut off : as noted in the table , after friday , august 31 st at 6 pm there can be no changes ( i . e . re - nominate , re - track , re - balance , bridge back to sitara etc . ) made to august production until wednesday morning , september 5 th .
at 6 pm friday ( or before if you are ready ) i will be by to pick up the reports and exceptions dialogue .
thx
