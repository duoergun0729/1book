Subject: ranks communication
after getting your imput , i think this is the best :
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a
bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a
better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be
different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing
the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus .
let me know what you think .
thanks
