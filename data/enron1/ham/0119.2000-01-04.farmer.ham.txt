hi julie , i have a question and i wasn ' t sure of who to start with . i have a
new meter for c & e operating , meter # 0989813 that started up nov . 29 . i have
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29 th and 30 th , a
total of 660 mmbtu . the problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #
9813 for 11 / 99 production . i looked in sitara , ( sitara # 132030 ) and the
deal starts for 12 / 99 production . i checked with donald to make sure and
he says that the meter did start up 11 / 29 and the price is hsc less $ . 10 . in
order to get this deal into the system , who do i need to talk to ? ? ?
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )
