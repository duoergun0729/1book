pat ,
this is the texaco fee cp , it flowed a total of 1 , 517 from dec 99 to apr 2
2000 . there is a strangers agmt . set up to take allocations , however , this
must be a wellhead related pt . that has declined . how do i go about finding
out who this belongs to ? i thought about ringing texaco , but , wanted to
check before i made any calls .
mary

anita ,
if you are no longer handling this meter , please pass this email on to the
correct person .
for meter # 6563 , i have meter statements showing that volume did flow for
12 / 99 - 4 / 00 production on this meter . i am not seeing this volume in volume
management for these production months . for 5 / 00 and 6 / 00 production , the
volumes are there . is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up ?
please let me know .
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )
