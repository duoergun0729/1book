pg & e will probably try to bill us for parking a volume of 10 , 263 for august 8
and 9 at $ . 03 / mmbtu each day . please do not pay this charge when we receive
this invoice . pg & e was unable to make deliveries into el paso because of
high sulfur content in their gas and is trying to charge us with a parking
charge for gas that they could not deliver . please let me know if you need
any additional information . thanks .
