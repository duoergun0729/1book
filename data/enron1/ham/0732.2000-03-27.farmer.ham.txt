karie : deal number 60747 should be the good deal . deal number 60747 is an
interruptible storage deal and contract 96016959 is an interruptible
contract . storage deal 47472 is a firm storage deal . since it doesn ' t agree
with the firmness of the contract , i would probably cut off that deal going
forward . - tommy

tommy :
there are two storage deals that are using the same contract number . julie
meyers believes that deal 47472 is the correct deal , but wants to check with
you first since you put in deal 60747 . let me know when you look at them if
we need to cut off or kill deal 60747 .
