we need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv . i am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand fee for feb 2001 for $ 29 , 851 . 64 , so i think we just need to change that to the new amount . let me know if you want to handle this differently .
