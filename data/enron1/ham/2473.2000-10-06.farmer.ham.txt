Subject: re : duke cashout entries 7 / 00 and 8 / 00
we did take into account the price adjustments you made . the actual purchase
cashout for 8 / 00 was $ 118 , 103 . 67 . your pricing took care of most of the
cashout , but there was still a balance . the over delivery pricing per mmbtu
in the contract is the difference between hsc spot - 0 . 05 and hsc index , so
gd - 0 . 10 didn ' t quite cover the entire cashout . i have attached the calc
sheet in case you need it .
