Subject: your mom
remember me ? i ' m the one who loved you so much that i gave my very best at
raising you . and now i ' m missing you so much . lacy & i can ' t understand why
you don ' t call to check on us & just to talk a while - - it doesn ' t count that
tonya calls - - i didn ' t raise her . we want to hear your voice every once in a
while . i know you work a lot , but you used to find time once a week . and
that ' s no excuse . you can schedule in a call to us . we ' re still your family
too . we love you , ma
