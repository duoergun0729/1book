Subject: neon discussion november 15
here are some ideas for discussion this week . ? ?
?
next week we won ' t be meeting , and after that we will have only two meeting
times left before christmas . ? be thinking about what you ' ll want to do as a
group ? for the last meeting , since it ' ll be here real soon . ? some groups have
a party , with a chinese gift exchange ( why is it called chinese ? ) , or some
go to eat somewhere and then go as a group in a van or suburban to look at
christmas lights , etc . ? if your group doesn ' t have some tradition or
enjoyable end to the semester , be imaginative and see if you can ' t come up
with something fun to do . ? of course if you need help let me know !
