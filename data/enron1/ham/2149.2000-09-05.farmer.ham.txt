daren ,
i believe the best way to enter the fee into sitara would be as a demand fee
in your example # 1 .
if we do the fee this way , we will not double up the volumes .
i have attached my spreadsheet for support :
the most current worksheet is tab # 2 marked final
column g is the over - delivery quantity total is 17 , 278 mmbtus
column s is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due hplc
$ 1 , 008 . 87
column t is the daily dollar amount for the over - delivery quantity due the
customer $ 519 . 73 .
thanks -

katherine ,
there are 2 ways that i can enter this fee into sitara :
1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i
can ' t just input a dollar amount in sitara .
let me know how you want to handle it .
