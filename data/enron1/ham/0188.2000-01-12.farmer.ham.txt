Subject: re : hl & p for 12 / 99
it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .
thanks ,

for days 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 28 , we are short at the aggregate
meter . should the reliant transport and sales or do we charge reliant a
penalty ?
also , i notice that at meter 1554 we have 3 rd party transport this month .
this look strange because i ' ve not seen them here before .
please advice .
thanks
