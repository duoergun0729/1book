other write - off ' s and send to daren farmer for approval . get daren to put
the proper deal tickets in mops and then let me know how to path this gas . i
will then set up accounting arrangements and get these volumes in the
system . the months in question are november and december of 1999 , february
2000 , and june 2000 .

please let me know a date when you think that we can get this resolved .
