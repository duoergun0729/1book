jackie :
meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 in march 2000 . also last month when you were out , robert
removed the volume from the liquids contract at this meter and temporarily
put it on a strangers gas contract . if you could fix both months today and
let me know when it is corrected i would appreciate it .
thanks ,
fred

jackie :
i am new at the 3 rivers allocation so bear with me , i took this over from
anita luong . in january 2000 , and going forward , please make sure that
meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 . the contract is currently out of balance by the total
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning
i would appreciate it .
thanks ,
fred
