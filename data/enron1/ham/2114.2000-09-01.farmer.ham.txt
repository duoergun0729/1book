elizabeth ,
sorry , i can ' t remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what .
were you looking into this issue for me or was it passed to someone else .
please see the email below . i believe the system is pulling in the wrong
price for waha . wtx . if . m . i . . for 5 / 00 production . the deal # is 250237 .
i looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $ 2 . 95 .
the price of $ 2 . 95 plus $ 1 would equal the price of $ 2 . 96 which is what duke
is
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $ 3 . 95 .
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )

elizabeth ,
i have a pricing discrepancy and i was not sure if i send this to you or
oneil .
it ' s for duke energy , 5 / 00 production , deal # 250237 . duke believes our
price is too high . the system downloaded a price of $ 3 . 95
the price should be waha . wtx . if . m . i . , which is $ 2 . 95 for that month . (
waha . wtx . if . m . i . + 1 ) duke believes we should have paid them $ 2 . 96 .
i think the system pulled in the wrong price . could you please let me know
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else ?
