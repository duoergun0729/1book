Subject: duke exchange deal - supply
deal # 231757
purchase
the deal in sitara indicates that the price for east texas gas systems is
hsc , index - $ . 085 .
per the contract , the redelivery at etgs carthage hub tailgate should be
priced at hsc index - $ . 0825 .
are these the same points and is the price correct ?
thanks
