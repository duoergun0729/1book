Subject: 98 - 9794 ( saxet )
the above meter is currently doing 13 . 0 on a 26 . 0 nom .
please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution .
looking @ deal # 109670 , the terms indicates that hplc buys 2 . 5 % of saxet
volumes . should i assume that i should take the total flow amount ( per day
for this deal ticket ) and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that
is 2 % of the daily flow versus the " 1 " that is currently nomed ?
h - e - l - p ! ! !
thanks
