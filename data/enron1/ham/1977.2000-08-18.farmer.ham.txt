Subject: unify passwords will be reset under sybase 12 . 0
all ,
when we convert unify to sybase 12 . 0 , all passwords will get reset to
" houston " . once you login to unify you will have to change you password .
this is an unavoidable side affect of migrating to sybase 12 . 0 .
thanks ,
chris
