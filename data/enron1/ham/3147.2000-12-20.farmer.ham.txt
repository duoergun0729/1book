we will need a small staff to handle potential trades for wed . the 27 th .
most of the pipelines are out of the office , so i would expect the work load
to be minimal . i plan on coming in , and would like to have a minimum of
three on staff , so i need two volunteers ( one offsystem , just in case ) . if
anyone is going to be in town , please forward a number , in case we need to
call any additional people in , or have you work on a laptop from home . i
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss , or , you
can schedule your day now , i have the calendars . also , i will be out on
vacation friday , dec . 22 nd and will need someone to send the nominations to
the plants , i don ' t expect to have full system coverage , just hpl / hpl and
hpl / ena as needed . let me know if you are interested in learning how to do
this .
thank you ,
mary
