Subject: desk to desk deals
during mid - july , sitara will change the logic on desk to desk deals to post
the volume associated with the sales ( seller ) side to the sitara deal .
currently , the volume on the receipt ( buyer ) side is being posted . this
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently
being used in sap . this change should help to avoid intercompany imbalances .
please be aware that this change will effect desk to desk deals only . the
logic on transport usage deals will remain as it is currently - delivery
point ( to ) - posts to the sitara deal .
if you have any questions , please give me a call at x 39222 .
chao !
