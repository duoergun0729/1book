darin ,
since the volume on this ena deal is on pgev ( epgt texas ) pipeline , the ena volume management contact is hakeem ogunbunmi . his number is x - 31801 and he has been cc ' d on this note .
fyi - ena volume management has assumed all of the volume duties associated with all texas deals that are not specifically on houston pipe line . for those on houston pipe line , i will still be the contact . if you have any questions , please let me know .

buddy - daren farmer called and said that on 4 / 30 / 2001 , on hpl deal # 108058 , that there was around 20 , 000 mmbtu scheduled , but when it was actualized , it was actualized at 0 . he thinks this is incorrect . can you check into this and get back with daren ? i ' ll be out of the office tomorrow , so please get back with him directly . thanks .
