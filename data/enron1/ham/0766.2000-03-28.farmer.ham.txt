i ' m not sure what ' s going on , but i did not see a teco deal ticket in mops
for houston pipeline company anywhere ( january 1999 to march 1999 ) . i did
see one on houston pipeline company resources .
as my original note stated , i think this is a buy / sell which means that teco
gas processing should appear in both the market and supply depending on
hplc ' s position .
please let me know something asap .

mops hplc sale to teco gp 12 - 86978 - 101 needed ( think this is buy / sell

connection with the seven oaks / turpentine lease line renewal , and it doesn ' t
appear to have hit the system . please ensure that the contract is set up and

george ,
at the 9 th workday meeting you had asked if we had seen the paper on the
above referenced . i have checked our database , and it appears that we have
not . the contract in the system does reflect at gs at this point .
i also checked on teco gas processing company , and it does not appear we have
seen the paper on this one either .
thank you ,
melissa
