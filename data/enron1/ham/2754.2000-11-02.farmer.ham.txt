subject : revised allocation % ' s - october
attached is a revised allocation file for october . please note that the
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list .
also , " global markets " and " industrial markets " have been broken out for
billing purposes . if you have cost centers that are allocating to either of
these teams , please provide a breakdown of those percentages by monday ,
november 6 th .
all other allocations are due by end of day today .
i have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until
the end of 2001 .
thank you for your help . please call if you have any additional questions .
