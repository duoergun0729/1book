gary , mainline valves to be closed on the 18 " 3026 line are as follows :
u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back
in service on 4 / 16 / 00 .

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .

i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .
