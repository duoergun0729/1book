Subject: new pictures
for faster viewing , i would suggest you go to the first page of pictures and
click the " small slideshow " link . this will bring down all the photos at
once , and will cycle through all of them four times in a slideshow . please
note that it might take some time to download all the pictures , depending
upon the speed of your connection to the internet .
after the slideshow starts , all of the regular - sized pictures on the other
pages will temporarily be on your pc , which should make clicking through
each page a little faster .
if you run into problems viewing any of the pages / pictures , please drop me a
note .
tonya / daren : you will probably be more interested in the pictures on pages 5
and 6 , which is also the fifth and sixth rows of the index page .
thanks ,
