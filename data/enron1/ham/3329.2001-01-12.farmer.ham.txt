please follow the instructions below .
why : a suggestion was made ( by carlos ) to centralize transport nominations
we receive by email . we now have an email account set up :
hpl . scheduling @ enron . com . the group is to let our customers know this is
where all nominations need to be sent . this way , if people are out ( or no
longer with us ) , someone will be able to receive the nomination change . i
have also created folders for each shipper . as each nomination is addressed ,
the file is to be moved to the folder for later reference . if the file is
still in the " inbox " , it has not been addressed .
any comments to this , i would greatly appreaciate feedback .
