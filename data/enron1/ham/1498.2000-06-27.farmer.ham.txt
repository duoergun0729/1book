wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might
involve your desks via eol in the near future . we already have one in the
east . i stressed to the sitara / eol folks the importance of adding comments
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is
happening . one side of these buy / sell or exchange deals will be ratable and
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the
counterparty desires .
i hope this helps . . . thanks !

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
the one communicating with the counterparty ) . we probably need eol to
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .
linda / karen - what are your thoughts on how separate gtc would work on this .
if we could all do a little homework . i will get something scheduled for
next week to discuss further .

we are positioning ourselves to release a new product type that we will refer
to as a flexible physical gas product . legal is in the process of drafting a
gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
party a buys 10 , 000 mmbtu per day ( or 300 , 000 total mmbtu ) at tco pool index
party b has the right to notify party a of when party b wants to take
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . ; if
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of
sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .
bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then
my turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
please feel free to call if you have any questions .
