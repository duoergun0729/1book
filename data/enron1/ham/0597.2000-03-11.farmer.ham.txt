robert ,
i ' ve taken care of 98 - 6719 ( as far as getting it out of my allocation
exception screen ) . i ' m going to place 98 - 9676 on strangers gas until you
hear back from daren or julie .
should daren or julie get back w / you , while i ' m on vacation , please get back
w / anita luong and provide her with the k # given to you ( by daren or julie )
as well as the dates of 2 / 1 - 2 / 29 ( even though 3 / 1 / 2000 is reflected in my
allocation exception screen ) so that she can provide you with an accounting
arrangement to place february ' s volumes on @ this meter .
it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter .
thanks

hi daren ,
can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters
can be rolled and extended ? if so , can you please perform this for me so
that anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me ?
98 - 6719 sitara deal # 166989 flow @ meter began on february 10 th but the deal
is not effective until february the 11 th .
no new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag . this is on the
gathering ( 96026573 ) k which is the only
k @ the meter .
98 - 9676 sitara deal # 151669 deal good from 1 / 1 / 00 - 1 / 31 / 00 but there is
flow for all of february 2000 with no k . this is on the 215 k for 1 / 2000
production which is the only k @ the meter .
thanks
