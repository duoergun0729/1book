mike ,
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .
buddy
