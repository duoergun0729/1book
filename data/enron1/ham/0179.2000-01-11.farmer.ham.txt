Subject: rollout schedule for unify real - time deal / path updates
a walk - thru / demo of this new functionality was held today with the logistics
managers and representative schedulers from each region except for texas and
calgary . the changes were well received and no revisions were requested .
they would like to have the changes migrated to production the evening of
tuesday , january 18 for use the morning of wednesday , january 19 .
paul , could you please insure that the network folks have the tibco install
complete by monday , including terminal server .
scotty , paul may need one of your folks to insure that the tibco install
works ok on terminal server ( none of us have access ) .
scotty , can you follow up with calgary and texas since they missed the demo .
also , what level of security is desired for the rollout - selected
schedulers or all of logistics ?
dave m , plan to have the last few related items in stage by monday to insure
all is clean by tuesday night . ( print , filter , closed path list , & app close
error msg )
if you do not feel like this schedule can be met , please let me know as you
become aware .
thanks , d . n .
