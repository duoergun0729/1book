rebecca :
i spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice . there
appears to be a problem for august 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low .
either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing , or there is
a problem with the hpl data . i am having brain fade and cannot remember the
name of the person in the measurement department to contact , so maybe you
could look into this and have it corrected .
thanks
lee
