panenergy purchase : deal # 231758 .
gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for april lst was purchased from panenergy on
deal # 231758 .
however , scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day
one and as a result , it is not pathed in the system .
could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn ' t be a sale
so that scheduling can either path april lst or i can dispute the volume
being billed to us by pan energy .
this is part of pan energy ' s exchange deal .

as i told thu before ( see below ) , i did not see any volumes for that deal
in 4 / 00 . i think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in
march and probably should be allocated to that month . i dont show a deal to
purchase or sell that gas in april . if you have any more questions please let
me know , thanks .

katherine ,
this is a brokered deal ( buy deal 231758 and sell deal 93472 ) . this first
day was not pathed , that ' s why you are missing volume of 271 . per carlos
( see below ) the deal was not for day one .
