Subject: meter # 0989814 - gmt , inc . - 1 / 00 production
stephanie ,
the problem with the january payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly
in sitara . for january production deal 153864 shows hplc purchasing gas
from gmt company inc , not gmt inc . someone needs to either correct the deal
for 1 / 00 or put in a new deal , then i can do an accounting arrangement to
make the necessary correction . it is correct for 2 / 00 on deal 156292 . i
emailed daren on this because i see his name in sitara as the contact , but i
am not sure who actually takes care of it .

pass this email on to the correct person .

company . the gas was allocated to gmt company inc . , but it should have been
allocated to gmt , inc . for feb . 2000 it is done correctly .
i need to recoup the money from gmt company , so could you please let me know
when the change has been made in the system .

nick , it appears that we paid gmt company , inc . ( ba 01474 ) of corpus christi
instead of gmt , inc . ( ba 75046 ) of houston . these companies are not
related . we should pay the houston gmt for production at meter 098 - 9814 .
would you please make the necessary adjustments ? thanks .

cindy , gmt has advised brian that they have not yet received payment for
production at meter 098 - 9814 for the period from 1 / 14 / 2000 to 1 / 31 / 2000 .
would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible ? it
appears that the january deal was 156292 and i believe gmt produced 15 , 984
mmbtu in january .

brian , for your information . please note robert ' s cautionary warning with
respect to additional wells that gmt may want to drill and add to this
meter . does gmt have additional drilling plans ? if so , should we alert them
to the gas quality issue early on ?

although the gas is non - spec , the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough
that it can be blended okay before reaching beaumont . go for it .
as a precaution , we are starting a trend and i want to be very cautious .
once we connect a well , we can ' t go backwards . please be specific with gmt
and limit him to this one well . otherwise he could drill more wells and flow
them all through this new meter .
