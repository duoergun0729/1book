it is my understanding the outages valero incurred at the above locations are
force majure situations during december and should not trigger the buyback
feature of the contract .
gary , i have not seen any documentation of this from valero . please follow up
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to
process the deal as if the buyback is active .
thanks
