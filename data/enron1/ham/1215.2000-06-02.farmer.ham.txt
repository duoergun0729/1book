these are revised schedules for jan , mar , & apr 2000 and the estimate
( scheduled ) volumes for may .
the prices were revised to capture texas general storage revenue ( fuel
retention ) in jan , mar , & apr . the fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy
price for the storage book .
the april also has volume true - ups due to actual metered volumes . ( schedule
6 ) . another adjustment was made in april to true up the cumulative facility
balance , ( 4 , 295 mmbtu ) .
thanks ,
kenny
