Subject: neon discussion january 24
here is an idea for this week . ? next week brad cox is planning on starting a
discussion series based on the experiencing god study , that he will modify
for teenagers to be used in neon . ? it will probably consist mainly of
questions similar to what you ' re getting this week . ? at this point in the
semester your kids hopefully feel comfortable with each other to go ahead
and spring right into some biblically relevant discussions . ? make sure ,
though , that you do what is necessary for your kids to connect with each
other and with you as adults and to make visitors feel at ease . ? spend time
visiting together as a group , and then individually with the kids after neon
is officially over with cokes and cookies . ? remember that that the " before
and after " is probably the most important aspect of neon .
- different beliefs . doc
