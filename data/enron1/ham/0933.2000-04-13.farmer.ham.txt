Subject: re : brandywine meter # : 981225 ; march , 2000 activity
just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion .

there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .
thanks
