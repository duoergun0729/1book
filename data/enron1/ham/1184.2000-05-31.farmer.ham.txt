steve / daren ,
i interviewed this candidate and really liked her . she has previous
allocations and settlements experience , but really wants to do financial
accounting . as you will see on her resume , she is doing internal auditing at
foleys . she was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do
allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and
traders , although she doesn ' t necessarily want to schedule or trade . she
mentioned risk specifically . i think she would be an asset to enron . please
use at your discretion . thanks !

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
" bean - counter " and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon
