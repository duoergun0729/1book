Subject: note from ken seaman
hi ,
?
how is the family ? ? ? ? and the multiple jobs ? ? ? ? ? ?
?
we just got back from omaha - - - linda ' s 40 th high school reunion . i wish
someone would explain to me who all those old people were that attended .
?
putting $ 1 . 85 a gallon gas in that beast of hers was sure fun . i may need a
part - time job if this keeps up long . ( just kidding - - you probably have
enough to deal with - - right )
?
jennifer has decided to journey off to law school at baylor . she and linda
are going to waco friday to finalize an apartment .
chris is managing the i - 10 texas land & cattle store . keeps him very busy .
( can ' t even send an e - mail - - - - - like someone else i know ) ( just kidding )
?
we are looking for property on a lake ( linda ' s request ) . like there is
anything like that left in texas . we will probably drop in this house .
?
pretty quiet here all things considered .
?
drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time . or if you are
really free we could actually plan a lunch . the price of natural gas should
help keep tom from hassling you too much .
?
