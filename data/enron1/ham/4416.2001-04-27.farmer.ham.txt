Subject: re : hpl transport contracts
i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with
hpl or channel .
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience ,
can hpl sever the point some other way ?
someone let me hear what you think .
thanks
bob

subject : hpl transport contracts
i spoke with daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of :
1 . channel - 012 - 15600 - 02 - 069 ena using hpl ' s capacity - selling to equistar on channel
2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts
let me know if anyone has questions . thanks !
