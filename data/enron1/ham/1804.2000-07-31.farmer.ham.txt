Subject: 75 th anniversary celebration
thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request . there
has been some confusion concerning the dinner only option . if you are
planning to spend the night , you do not need to respond to that option . it
is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night .
we are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the hpl
anniversary celebration . please email me with the name you would like to
appear on your nametag , such as nicknames , etc . if we do not hear from you
by wednesday , august 2 , we will use the name as it appears in the list we
acquired from hr . please print this memo for any employees who do not have
access to email .
thank you so much for your help .
