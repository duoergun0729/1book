Subject: pathing question
daren ,
howard set up the shell meters to one buyback ticket - i haven ' t
been pathing the shell meters . before aimee had it set up
individual and howard said that it should all be tied to one .
am i causing a problem by not pathing the meters now ?
should i go back and path the deal changes ?
