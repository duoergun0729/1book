subject : prelminary findings on deals not bridging
i ' ve attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to unify for
november . please don ' t let this alarm you , this is how the bridge has always
worked . if you have questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
every instance i ' ve found looks okay because of the following :
* a transport ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* the deal didn ' t have a point assigned to it , only a zone
thanks
