Subject: mgi supply jan 2001
darren :
i have a price issue with mgi supply for january 2001 . for deal 551414 , we have tiered pricing for days 13 - 16 . the first 20 , 000 at $ 8 . 71 and everything over at agua dulce gdp + $ 0 . 01 . mgi has the deal priced at the gdp + $ 0 . 01 only . they do not have the $ 8 . 71 . should this pricing be tiered ? mgi would owe us $ 10 , 600 . 00 if we go with their pricing .
