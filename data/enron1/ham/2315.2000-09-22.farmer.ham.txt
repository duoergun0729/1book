duke will be paid 9 / 22 for may 2000 through july 2000 . we should have the
august 2000 invoice by the end of next week . megan parker is handling this
deal going forward and has contacted duke to request an invoice for august .
megan was not receiving invoices , and since it is our policy to withhold
payment unless we are invoiced , payment was not made on this until now .
