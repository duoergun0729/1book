mike :
i am down to the last few error messages on the epgt quick response and also looking into the external pool for who 34 in unify . about 70 % of the line items have been cleaned up .
i need the following information from you as soon as possible .
1 . the downstream contract number for aquila marketing and a " scheduled quantity report " for the pooling contract who 34 , this is the report you would obtain from the pipeline at the end of each cycle to determine cuts etc . or you can give me the user id and password
and i can go pull it myself .
the epgt ' s it group is trying to research the correct duns # for aquila dallas marketing . if this issue is not resolved , i am planning on setting up a meeting with el paso on november 26 th at 1 : 30 at their offices and i would like for you to go with me . we will meet with their it and business group for about an hour or so .
your prompt attention to this will be greatly appreciated .
thank you .
