aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .
thanks in advance for your help ,
fred
