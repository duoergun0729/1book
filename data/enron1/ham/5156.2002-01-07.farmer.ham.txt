tammy , richard - i would richard to take ownership of the training that would be required for the new scheduling people that will be on each desk . you can coordinate who needs training with the managers . this needs to happen asap . also if you can line up some basic sitara training for those that need it that would be helpful . not sure who can do the sitara piece but you can run the traps on that . i will include this effort in the plan that will be forwarded to louise today .
let me know if you get some dates together , tks - bob
