if the plants become an external counterparty , the fee should probably go
back to the
scale in the original contract . the assumption being that the original plant
financing could afford
the escalating fee .
let me know if you want me to look into it any further .
thanks

darren ,
how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .
john
