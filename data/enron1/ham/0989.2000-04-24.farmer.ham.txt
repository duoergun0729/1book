Subject: popsprd migration
the popsprd bridge will be migrated to nahou - scacll on april 26 th for
debugging purposes . this migration should be transparent for pops users with
the exception of personal spread sheets using pops tags . the node name for
pops tags on personal spread sheets will need to be changed to nahou - scacll
to allow for updating of pops data .
please call me if you have any questions concerning the migration .
