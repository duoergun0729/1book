new developments . merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now
been named . he is brandon aaron byington
hi there , darren & tonya ,
merry and doc had their new baby at 9 : 26 am yesterday . no name yet . they are
still trying to settle on one , so in the mean time , i ' m just calling him " new
child " byington .
he weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1 / 4 " long . merry , doc , and " new child " are
doing fine . doc was in there during the whole delivery ( c section ) so he says
he was a bit shakey there a time or two .
here are some digital camera pics i took when " n . c . " was less thasn an hour
old .
