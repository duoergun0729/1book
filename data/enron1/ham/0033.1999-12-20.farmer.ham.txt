i ' m sorry , did we discuss bmc ? ? ? .
lee can confirm the accuracy of this , but bmc bought 20 , 000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback . brandywine ( dorcheus ) controlled the meter ,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders . i
believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
november . if not please let me know .
lee , if this is not your understanding for nov . business please let us all
know .
thanks

lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .
