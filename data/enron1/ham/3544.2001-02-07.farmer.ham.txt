subject : opm hours survey - january , 2001 - changes ! ! please read !
it ' s that time again to enter your hours and activities for january , 2001 .
please use the shortcut below or go to the following path o : \ energy _ ops \ opm
hours survey \ produser to access the hours survey .
please note that there are some changes this month in the survey . they are
as follows :
1 ) you must use your new sap cost center in the survey this month . i have
attached a file that converts your old cost center incase you don ' t know what
your new one is .
2 ) due to the sap cost center conversion , we were unable to roll over
previous months commercial teams and headcount ( fte ) information . therefore ,
we need you to enter the commercial teams your cost center supports and the
fte ' s in your cost center . we will roll this information over beginning next
month .
3 ) in previous months you were able to print a report that showed your prior
months hours by activity . due to the sap cost center conversion , that
function is not available this month . it will be available next month . if
you need your hours for prior months please call me and i will forward this
information to you .
when completing the fte ' s section of the survey , if there are any director ,
sr . admin or admin positions in your cost center , please complete
accordingly . you are not expected to complete a hours survey for these
positions but we do need them to be included in your fte ' s .
please have your survey ' s completed by wednesday , february 7 . please call me
if you have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey .
thanks ,
suzanne
