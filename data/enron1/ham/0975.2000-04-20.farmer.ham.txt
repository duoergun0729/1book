heidi - there should be a deal ticket in sitara for this sale to engage , but
it looks as though 12 / 99 was the last month a deal was entered
( if / hsc + 1 . 00 ) . george / craig - could you guys coordinate who should be rolling
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing ? heidi -
historically we ' ve been charging $ . 60 / mm for this transport .
