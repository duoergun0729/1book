Subject: performance feedback
each of you have been chosen by one or more of my direct reports to provide
mid - year feedback . i just wanted to urge you to provide this to me asap , as
my prc meeting wil be 6 / 13 , even though the feedback system is open through
6 / 16 . therefore , i need your feedback by friday , 6 / 9 so that i can use the
week - end to get ready . although i would prefer the feedback through the
system , if you are finding yourself in a bind for time , please provide me
your feedback verbally either through voicemail ( mark it private ) or i would
be happy to meet with you .
i know we all receive many of these requests , but i sincerely appreciate
constructive feedback . thanks in advance for your input !
