Subject: hplc - four square 5 / 01
darren :
i have another hplc issue . . . i received an invoice from four square gas company today for may 2001 gas that was never paid . they have invoiced 1 , 654 at 4 . 825 ( hsc - . 085 ) at meter 986887 . i did not see a deal in unify , so i went to pops to find the meter . i found that the gas was pathed to the strangers gas contract . historically , hplc has always purchased the gas at this meter from four square , but it doesn ' t look like a deal was ever entered for may . the april deal number was 695469 . did hplc purchase this gas in may ?
