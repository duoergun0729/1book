fyi - this is the " day 1 " list that you worked on consolidated into one spreadsheet . as you can see the logistics managers for each desk , working with suzanne and me will be responsible for getting this done . suzanne is putting together a master binder and will start reviewing the requirements with each of you to get as much done ahead of time as possible . in the master binder will be the more detailed spreadsheets with the additional , and critical , notes you included .
let me know if you have any questions , tks . in addition tammy is working on the tpa ' s and ebb ' s to get the major edi pipes up and running asap .
