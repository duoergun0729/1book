look thru the sequence history . the meter # on the opposite side did not change
even though the pipe code did . that is all i have to suggest .

i need to get the approval from daren farmer ext . 3 - 6905 . please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter .
also , i do not believe the meter no . will be the same . i searched pi
grid and it shows hpl with drn 92686 interconnect with meter no .
237 - 07 - 1 - 004 , drn 26879 for teco pipeline co .
we have discrepencies / isssues .
what verifying information do you have for this meter ?
