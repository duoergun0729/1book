each month at seven oaks , teco ( pg meter no . : 6884
greg , this relates to the seven oaks tailgate accounting issue we have been
discussing . hplr once had an appropriate agreement in place , but that
agreement has been assigned to ect . until the agreement can be re - assigned
from ect to hplc , we will use spot gtcs to clear the puchase / sale accounts
for the period from 10 / 98 to 6 / 99 or perhaps 7 / 99 .

enron capital meter no . : 6884
julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451
per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments ?
when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?
thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional
information .
cc ' s :
let me know if something i stated is incorrect or if anyone has any
additional information .
