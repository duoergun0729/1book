great . keep in mind - some people continue to confuse " wellhead portfolio "
with " deals done by producer services . " all that should be in the wellhead
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by greg sharp ' s
origination teams at competitive points . does that make sense ?

i worked with tom acton last night to get the wellhead portfolio cleaned up .
tom had a sheet from vance that we used to determine what deals should be in
the portfolio . i believe the portfolio is now correct . the sitara team will
move the deals we identified today .
