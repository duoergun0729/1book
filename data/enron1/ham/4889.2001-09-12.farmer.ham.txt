importance : high
as individuals involved in the day - to - day oversight and management of ppep ' s cleburne facility , it ' s important that you are familiar with and follow the covenants set out under the purchase agreement signed with mesquite investors , llc ( an el paso affiliate ) on september 7 . those covenants are contained in section 5 . 4 of the purchase agreement , which is attached for your reference .
the covenants are fairly self - explanatory . however , if you have any questions concerning their interpretation or implementation , please contact joe henry at ( 713 ) 345 - 1549 or me at ( 713 ) 853 - 6027 .
