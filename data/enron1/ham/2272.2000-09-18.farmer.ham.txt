subject : hpl curtailment plan
we are going to be reviewing the hpl curtailment plan , with the ultimate
issue being how does hpl best structure its curtailment program to comply
with regulatory requirements and to best suit hpl  , s business purposes .
attached is a memo meant to provide a brief summary about what a curtailment
plan is and some of its ramifications . we  , ll be setting up a meeting soon
to discuss the issues surrounding the curtailment regulations and their
significance to hpl . certainly there will be critical legal , regulatory ,
commercial , operational , gas control , accounting , and even public relation
issues to be considered in this deliberation . whatever the decision may be
as to what to do , we must also determine how to find out relevant facts ,
establish the processes to be followed , and perform the necessary procedures
to implement our action plan .
