sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

should work .

ed ,
sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below .
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th . pg & e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco , and claim that they are
net deals . i do not show a sale in the system at the meter , and i checked
the 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco , perhaps at
another meter , and could not find one .
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated .
