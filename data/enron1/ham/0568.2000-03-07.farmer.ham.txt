daren ,
on january 15 and 16 , hpl bought some gas from western gas resources at the
aquila header ( 10 . 000 and 5 . 000 mmbtu ' s respectively ) . this was a late
friday change so in order to get it scheduled in pops , the gas was scheduled
on the stranger ' s gas contract . however , deal ticket # 143709 was never
updated to reflect those late changes . please let me know if you want me to
update the deal ticket . thanks , susan .
