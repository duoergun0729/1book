is this date really june of 1999 ? hopefully we ' re not just finding out about
this ?
i don ' t think we can even process this request . the east desk was not up and
running on unify in june of 1999 . all of our pathing for june of 1999 was in
autonoms and it ' s not y 2 k compatabile . with the volumes involved being so
small and the accuracy of the data at enerfin in question , why don ' t we let
this volume hit the new oba at enerfin as a ppa ? ? ?
i welcome your thoughts .

daren ,
on the above mentioned dates , there was no nomination at the enerfin meter .
6 / 3 / 99 and 6 / 8 / 99 revealed activity for ena ( 202 k ) . can the deal be extended
for 6 / 4 ( 548 dec . ) and 6 / 9 ( 40 dec . ) to cover this flow so that volume
management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days ?
thanks
