daren :
i looked in path manager and i see two deals - 93480 and 93481 , but i don ' t
see deal 69176 for july forward that you mentioned below . also , please
verify that the deal for january through june is 93481 and if the 69176 deal
is correct for july forward .
stella :
i will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from january
forward . from daren ' s note below it appears that for january through june i
will need an hplr transportation contract put in pops . when daren and i get
the deal number issue resolved for july forward i will need an hplc contract
put into pops . also for july forward , i will need the hplc contract in pops
every month through december to allocate copano line gain to if it occurs .
thanks to both of you ,
fred

fred ,
i have pathed the purchase from copano for 1999 in mops . jan - jun is under
hplr ( sitara 93481 ) . july forward is under hplc ( sitara 69176 ) . i
understand that i cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months , because the
callout allocations will be affected . so , you will need to set up accounting
arrangements to get the nom into pops .
let me know if you have any questions .

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a " synergi " contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .
thanks ,
