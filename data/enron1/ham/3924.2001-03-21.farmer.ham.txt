i spoke to sabrae , we are cumulatively balanced with pge , cumulative and
don ' t want to do anything volumetric at either meter . the nng oba is being
reconciled , and they are really hesitant / reluctant to balance current month .
florida can be paid back 5 m or more , it is being reconciled , but , sabrae is
okay with paying back . this just in from mark mccoy , the oasis oba is flat
as of today ' s gas day . that should hit the imb . report next week .
