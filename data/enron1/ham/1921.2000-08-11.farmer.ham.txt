fyi
this is a reduction in total capacity from 528 , 000 to 400 , 000 at station 809 .
hpl has typically been running about 180 , 000 to 200 , 000 mmbtu through station
809 in august . we can pull more gas off of the a - s line at swan lake to keep
our throughput around the 175 , 000 .
my original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
around 400 , 000 mmbtu total during the maintenance . station 809 will be down
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
without 809 running . i will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
the volume bumped up ( to 400 , 000 ) and adjust on tuesday as necessary .
if you have any questions please call . 36449 .
