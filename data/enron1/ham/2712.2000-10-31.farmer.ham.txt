daren ,
i have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal . flow was for
the first 2 days only , and probably occured as the meter was in the process
of being shut in . we purchased the gas from torch - rally partnership in
sept . can you extend the deal , or should i allocated off to strangers ?
please advise .
mary
