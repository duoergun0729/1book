Subject: pipeline nominations away from the office .
these troubled times mandate that enron take a fresh look at our contingency plans for conducting business away from the office . bob superty has asked me to put together a survey on processes and equipment that could be used if schedulers could not get into the office and use normal business processes and resources .
please forward this memo and ask your respective schedulers to take a moment to fill in the requested data from your desk spreadsheets below . we would like to have all responses received before november lst .
please e - mail all responses to richard pinion with an updated excel spreadsheet attached . i will put together a master sheet from the individual replies .
thx
richard pinion
