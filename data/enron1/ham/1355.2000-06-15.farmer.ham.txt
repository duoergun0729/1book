subject : wholesale volumes
it ' s that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations !
the database for may is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this is
the shortcut on your desktop called " statistical database " .
as there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations , investor
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for may 2000 and provide explanations
for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year , quarter / quarter , and
month / month variances . the current objective of investor relations is to use
this analysis as a resource to answer potential investor or analyst
questions , but it may be used for ad hoc requests and presentations . it is
essential that the volumes be verified by commercial personnel .
please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10 : 00 am
on monday , june 19 . please feel free to call with any questions .
thanks ,
misti day
