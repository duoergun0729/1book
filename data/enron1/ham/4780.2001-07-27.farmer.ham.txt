Subject: happy birthday ! ! !
daren ,
i contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday .
however , i know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week
is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to
you ) .
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend .
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them .
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need ,
and for putting up with the " outlaws " . in addition to our friendship , i
love you as my own son . again , happy birthday .
