the actuals on this contract did not come in as scheduled . the scheduled
deliveries at texoma are 374 , 503 , but the actuals are 352 , 568 . at teco waha
delivery you have 359 , 120 scheduled , but the actuals are 368 , 115 . i don ' t
know what numbers you confirmed with pg & e texas , so can you let me know first
if you agree with pg & e texas numbers and if you do , will you please make the
necessary changes in unify .
