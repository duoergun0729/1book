Subject: aspect resources - meter # 78033 , # 78032 - 3 / 00 production
daren ,
i ' m not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me . if you
are not , could you please let me know who i need to speak to .
for meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3 / 00 production forward , this deal is set
up under the wrong sitara # , therefore the volumes are not pulling in sitara .
the sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal
was only for 1 / 00 production . the new sitara number that we should be using
is
sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032
) . i have attached an example to help see what i am talking about .
( this was for 2 / 00 production )
could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is
something that i need to do .
thanks , stephanie ( 3 - 6004 )
