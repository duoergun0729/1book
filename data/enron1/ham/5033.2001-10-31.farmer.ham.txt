Subject: bcp seat assignments
all :
attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for business continuity planning ( bcp ) . these seats are located on the 30 th and 31 st floors of enron center north ( ecn ) . as previously communicated , you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ecs .
the exception to this is as follows :
if your seat assignment is located on the 31 st floor , you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ecs . this will hold true until the monday after thanksgiving , as we will have the 31 st floor seats set up at that time .
testing :
once you have moved to ecs , if you would like to test your bcp location , you will be able to test your seat for functionality every thursday from 3 - 6 pm . testing is not required , but is highly recommended .
if anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures , please feel free to contact me at any time .
regards ,
