first of the month industrials are coming along fine . i will finalize my
pathing tomorrow , thursday , and set up buybacks and swings by the
end of day friday .
the industrial " buyback & deficiency deals " worksheet has captured the
necessary data to help gas control & the on - call scheduler as well as
myself and client services .
i will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day friday .
i am on vacation during the week of july 5 th thru july 10 th .

when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july ? i am a little
concerned with the long weekend coming up . i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .
( six days of flow . ) i definitely don ' t think that we should any later . it
would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
additionally , we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again . this report is very beneficial to gas control , industrial traders and
schedulers on call .
let me know what you think .
