Subject: equistar sale off of tejas or midcon
fyi . . . . for febo 0 only , equistar asked we deliver the gas under sitara
106736 to hpl meter 1373 instead ( the plant it was originally going to is
having some maintenance being done in feb ) .
while i ' ve already change the delivery point in the sitara ticket , maybe
something needs to bve done to the risk assignment . . . . .
