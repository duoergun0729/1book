mark ,
i understand that you need a note for your files regarding the tenaska plant .
on saturday , october 14 , 2000 at 5 : 14 am , the plant had a catastrophic
failure of the gas turbine . the entire plant is essentially shutdown until
these repairs can be made . this outage will last a minimum of 10 days . ken
riesz will keep you informed of our progress .
i hope this is what you need . let me know .
