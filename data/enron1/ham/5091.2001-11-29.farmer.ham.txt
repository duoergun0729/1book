hey fellas !
just for my records , each of you guys have paid the $ 20 dues for the
league . . . here ' s just a little last bit of info for you .
this is the last week of the regular season . . . after that comes the
divisional playoffs , followed by the superbowl .
the same week as the superbowl , another exciting game will be played for the
first time ever , pitting our 2 worst teams in the league against each other ,
hacking it out for bragging rights . . . the toilet bowl !
rewards break down :
superbowl winner : $ 125
runner - up : $ 50
toilet bowl champ : $ 25
thanks fellas , and get back with me if you are interested in doing a $ 5
college bowl sheet against each other . . . ( you know , where you pick the
winners from each bowl game ) . . . we already have a few who are in for this !
