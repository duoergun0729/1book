i need help on this one . i spoke to gary shortly after he sent this e - mail the other day . i wasn ' t sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in - - is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation ? are we ever going to take the gas again ? should i tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs ?
at gary ' s suggestion , i called mike morris & left a message , but haven ' t heard back from him . therefore , i am sending this e - mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that i need to send out .
thanks in advance for any help that you can give me .
