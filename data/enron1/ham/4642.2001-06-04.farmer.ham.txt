hi ,
the number is 281 - 370 - 7838 .
i did not think of it , but without the pipe one has to balance ones own , doesn ' t one . of course the major problem was the people with hpl , not the counter - parties . who ' s doing that for you guys ?
jen came home for the memorial day weekend so we just bummed around . saw pearl harbor , watched a few dvd ' s , and ate way to much .
when you get time let us know about your " bad luck " . i hope jake wasn ' t helping you too much .
i have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system . we finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of klipsch speakers . awesome is the only word to apply . i ' m sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door . ( it ' s a young couple with a baby ) ( not near as nice as the other young couple i know ) .
rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good . : )
stock market still sucks , but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we ' ll be ok .
i ' m off to get linda ' s gas guzzlin , environment ruining , suv washed and buffed . then i must re - stock my cd - r ' s and load up on some more music . you can see how well i ' m utilizing my time in doing productive things .
later ,
ken
p . s . i thought waha was where all the pillaging of california was taking place .
