jackie , talk to darren about this . the deal you reference is an hpl deal with
dynegy and i don ' t have access to it . i ' m on the east desk . yesterday i
extended the deal 421415 for the 6 th and 19 th and meredith inserted a path in
unify - tetco to cover the small overflow volume between hpl and ena . the
ena / hpl piece is done . the piece between hpl and dynegy is what you need
inserted . thanks

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

arre you saying that for both days that two ( 2 ) ena contracts should be
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the
total volume to each contract ?

jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

jackie ,
your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because
we have tiered pricing this month .
thanks .
