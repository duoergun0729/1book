subject : follow up
bob ,
i wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple weeks ago . we had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down with daren and working the off system scheduling .
i was talking with daren last night and he had not heard anything about this . i plan to begin working with mark and mary next week to learn how to schedule these pipes . before we begin this , i just wanted to make sure that what we had discussed is still planned .
thanks for your time .
mike
