daren , i ' m looking at s 93481 for 01 / 00 . 3 , 461 mmbtu was scheduled to copano
p / l in 02 / 00 and the counterparty was paid . in 05 / 00 the volumes were
reversed from this deal . would you be able to tell why they were reversed ?
i ' m trying to determine if this is a valid recoverable item . thanks .
