elizabeth ,
deal # 649741 is a 05 / 01 sale to bp energy . bp is claiming that this deal should have been invoiced by hpl and not ena . my contact also claims that this was confirmed by gary lamphier . i am not sure if gary is with ena or hpl . is this something you can look into or do i need to send this to someone else ?
thanks ,
genaro
