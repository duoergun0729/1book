Subject: re : lobo payout
because the payback was done for october 2001 , we can ' t do it in pops so we will have to make manual entries to clear the imbalance from the books and show the sale from hpl to ena .

rita ,
what time frame do intend to do this in ? i believe this contract is no longer effective after may 31 , so if it is in october you will have to reactivate the transport contract so you can book it in pops .

i talked to daren and he ' s going to put a deal in the system for the
sale of the gas from ena to aep , so there would be no need for a manual
invoice .
