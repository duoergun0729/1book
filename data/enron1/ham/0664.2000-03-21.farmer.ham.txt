this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until
month ' s end so systematically , no information equals zero . spi , the software
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
transfers , particularly 0 volumes . the only possible solution is to tag all
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to
complete . we may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the
investigation .

jeff / gary ,
where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
complete data ? we continue to have this problem at various bidirectional
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality . when mips sends
pipeline operations a zero prelim , this becomes the best available number and
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us . when this happens &
scheduling doesn ' t catch to override the zero , the desk ' s expense is
understated . this is causing a huge mess for texas operations . what is the
plan to move this up on measurements priority list ? we need an answer asap ! !
charlotte ,
at what other meters are we having this problem ?

i spoke with romeo d ' souza this morning regarding the on - going problem of
mips feeding zeros to pops when incomplete data is received .
in light of the e - mail below regarding how important it is that we receive
accurate data from mips . . . . could you please update me on the status of
this correction .
thank you so much .

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .
please give me a call if you have any questions .
