Subject: hplr liquids / humble gas pipeline
we need to get together this afternoon at 2 : 00 pm in room 3745 to discuss how
we will schedule and allocate the hplr liquids coming into humble gas
pipeline at meter 8793 . karry , it is my understanding that you do not want
an intercompany sale from hplr liquids to hplc at this point . how do you
plan to get this gas to king ranch since hplr liquids does not have a
transport on humble ?
daren , the intercompany hplc purchase is how it is set up currently in mops .
robert , since stella is out , we will need someone to represent logistics .
