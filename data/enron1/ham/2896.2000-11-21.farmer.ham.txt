i can not believe you are sending emails form hawaii ! ! ! ! you are crazy . i
took care of camden for the month -
it is now 330 and hilcorp has not responded . i spoke with jerry bubert
several times today - emailed mike lannou and left messages , and had him
paged , and copied hildebrand ( the president ) . if we don ' t hear by 4 pm , we
are supposed to bypass the gas . . . . . . . . . . .
