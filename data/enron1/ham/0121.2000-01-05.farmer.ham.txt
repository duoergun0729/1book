ken ,
i think robert has a good handle on things and can function on his own . with
that said , we always want different
checks and balances in place in order to capture the most accurate
information , so if you see something that is
a problem please bring it to our attention . thanks , pat

i believe the transition to be complete as we have , at least , been over the
ground on all the subjects . would you like me to continue offering advise
and assistance or let robert function entirely on his own ?
