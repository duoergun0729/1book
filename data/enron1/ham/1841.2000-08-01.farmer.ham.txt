i am referring to ken seaman ' s file which provides additional information .
we definitely need ken ' s
file completed by aug lst . and distributed to our group , daren farmer , and
gary hanks . both files should
be completed and can be linked on duplicate information . thanks , pat

i am confused . what file do you want me to update ; julie meyers file or ken
seaman file ?
both files provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support
groups .
to prepare both files i feel is a duplicate of my efforts . please let
know if you want both files updated
and the approximate time table for completion .

robert ,
ken developed an industrial report before he left . it can be found at
o / logistics / kenseaman / industrialsmonthly / . . . there is one file for each
month of 2000 . i need you to update this for march . this will need to be
distributed to gas control , logistics , and myself . let me know if you have
any questions .
