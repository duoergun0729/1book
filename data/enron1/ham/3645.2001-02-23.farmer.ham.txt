Subject: meter 981318
daren ,
the above meter recorded a flow on jan 15 this year . it has not had any
activity all the way back through 1999 . i checked with cheryl jones and the
flow is good . it was apparently turned on for that one day . do we need to
put in a deal for this flow ?
thanks .
also , we had a transport nom from texaco into king ranch , so we will have
adequate flow into stratton .
