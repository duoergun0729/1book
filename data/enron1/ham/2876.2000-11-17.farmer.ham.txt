deal # 421859 sales
deal # 421847 purchase
settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for texas general land
office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for
anything .
are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together ?
if so , the volumes are not matching : the sales on hpl are 7 , 440 mmbtus on
deal # 421859 and the purchase on midtx is 6 , 629 mmbtus .
let me know what type of deal this was intended to be .
fyi
i was told that tom acton was handling this deal , but i believe he will be
out until after thanksgiving .
