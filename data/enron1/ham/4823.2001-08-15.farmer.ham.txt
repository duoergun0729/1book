buddy - daren farmer called and said that on 4 / 30 / 2001 , on hpl deal # 108058 , that there was around 20 , 000 mmbtu scheduled , but when it was actualized , it was actualized at 0 . he thinks this is incorrect . can you check into this and get back with daren ? i ' ll be out of the office tomorrow , so please get back with him directly . thanks .
