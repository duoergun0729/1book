Subject: duke energy - # 5192 - 1999 issues
stephanie :
meter 6757 is done , redraft your invoice for both months and let me know if
this meter is still an issue .
meter 5192 . i never heard back from aimee on which transport contract to
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still
allocated to the strangers gas contract . aimee is out on vacation until
mid - june so i put in a call to daren farmer to find out which transport
contract i should attach the deal 269123 to .
when i find out which transport contract to use i will set up the accounting
arrangements and then get robert lloyd to put the contract in pops and
reallocate .

aimee :
please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with
the track id 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months . after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops . also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .
stephanie :
the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice . when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if
this issue is resolved .

the crow o ' connor , meter 6757 has its gas allocated to strangers gas for
april and may 1999 and duke has been calling settlements asking for their
money . i will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for
these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and
valid deal # for this transaction .
