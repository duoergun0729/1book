gentlemen - we have reviewed the aep corpaorate guaranty and have provided a
redline of the document to reflect our comments . we were not sure if we
should be dealing with dan or jim so we sent it to both . you can either
call byron gannaway at 9972 ) 628 - 2751 or phil schnorbach at ( 972 ) 628 - 2750
with comments or questions . we would be happy to wrap this up on friday if
