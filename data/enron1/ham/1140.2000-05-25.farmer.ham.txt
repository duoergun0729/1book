loraine sent an allocation for fuel that is not scheduled . her schedule has
fuel on days where there was no flow :
day fuel

can you let me know if we need to book fuel on this contract and what needs
to be done on days where we have no flow ?
we called loraine and she told us to contact you since you are aware of this .
