darren :
i think marta is referring to the supply deal 391119 on 9 / 6 for 10 , 545 . we
do not have a price of gd + $ 0 . 04 . we have if + $ 0 . 04 . please check this
price . also , they seem to be missing the overdelivery calculation in their
spreadsheet . attached is the september 2000 spreadsheet .
