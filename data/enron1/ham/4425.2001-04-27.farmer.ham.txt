tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin s # 745589 . and there are three deal out there for csgt # 639612 , # 639615 , # 745589 . the problem is that none of these deals have actuals . it looks as though they have not been nom ' d .
daren are these deals real or what ? why have they not been nom ' d ? could they be under another dow company ?
