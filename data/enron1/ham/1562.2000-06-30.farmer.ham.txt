Subject: july transport usage tickets
i have input and updated transport usage tickets for july . i did not update
one for the demand charge for pgev / maypearl delivery , so if there is one , you
will have to set it up in the system . if you have any questions , please let
me know . also , pay close attention to the oasis and pg & e tickets for this
month . i do not yet know what baseload rates you have agreed upon , so you
will need to adjust them in the appropriate tickets . if you would , please
let me know , too , what baseload business and rates you have agreed upon for
both these pipelines . thank you .
