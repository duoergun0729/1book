stella :
the swift deal is not pathed correctly in pops . i set up an accounting
arrangement on the 012 - 41500 - 02 - 015 contract with the track id 80705 . would
you put the contract in pops with the associated track id ?
the transportation contract ( 012 - 41500 - 02 - 003 ) for the liquids replacement
gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you
can put the contract at meter 9643 .
let me know when all of this is done so that i can reallocate the meter .
thanks ,
