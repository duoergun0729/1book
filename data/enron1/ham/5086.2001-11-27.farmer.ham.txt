prior to 7 / 99 this was ena not hpl , but there may be some issues on it as well for 3 / 99 to 6 / 99 . the deal ticket we used was 62717 . i will have to look further into the ena activity because i know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other .

daren ,
i am trying to get some payments out to williams for old months 11 / 2000 and 1 / 2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have black marlin pipeline company inc . instead of black marlin pipeline company effective 3 / 99 . the black marlin pipeline company was for an internal record ( when it was an enron entity ) .
