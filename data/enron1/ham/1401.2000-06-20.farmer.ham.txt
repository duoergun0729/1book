aimee ,
are you confirming these volumes with hl & p ? we have been doing some special
deals at green ' s bayou and the hl & p dealmaker has been calling to find out
what the volumes are . i do not think he communicates with his scheduler , is
that the case ? anyway , we need to agree with hl & p on what volumes flowed on
these special days and get them into the system so they can be billed
correctly .
