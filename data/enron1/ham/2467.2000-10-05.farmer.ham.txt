subject : cleburne plant
well , folks , the cleburne deal has started . the deal has not been finalized
through legal . however , we were able to " get between " a few deals and make
some money before we finalized it . the cleburne plant was down 7 / 31 - 8 / 7 and
8 / 31 . on these dates , we bought gas from tenaska iv texas partners and sold
to anp and tenaska marketing . because things were not set up , i could not
enter the deals until now . please review the following deals and settle with
the customers .
buy from tenaska iv
