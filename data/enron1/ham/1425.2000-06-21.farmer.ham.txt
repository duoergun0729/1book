Subject: desk summary report
the cpr report named desk summary is currently being reviewed for an
upgrade . i have been told that this report is used during bidweek to check
positions on a particular pipe ( for a particular zone ) . if you do not need
additional data , this report could very easily be added to the report
selection in the sitara reporting application . if anyone would like to see
more detailed information on the report , please let me know . there may be a
report that is already in production that they can access .
please let me know if the format currently in cpr is sufficient as soon as
possible .
chao !
