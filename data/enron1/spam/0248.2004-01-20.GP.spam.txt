international telephone services ( its ) is a telecommunications company born in 1995 and whose objective was to bring the most advanced technology in communications within the reach of its clients .
its started off offering a call - back service to a wide portfolio of foreigners on the costa del sol ( south of spain ) , then extending this to businesses also based in the area .
as of december 1998 , when full liberalisation occurred in the telecommunications market in spain , its focused its efforts on providing a made - to - measure service to each client at the best price and with a high level of quality . the company at this point offered primarily long distance national and international calls , prepaid calling cards , and intelligent numbers ( 90 x , 800 - type ) .
with the boom in the telecoms markets up to mid 2000 , its began to quote on the otcbb and began expanding its presence to other prime tourist locations in spain . unfortunately , the initiative did not have enough time to get traction before the dot . com bubble burst and with it dragged investor confidence in the rest of the telecommunications sector . by the end of 2001 , its downsized its operations and refocused its efforts on the south of spain in order to " ride out the storm . "
by january 2002 , actual shareholders , not happy with the financial or business results produced by the management at the time , and in the absence of a clear strategy to bring its back to the forefront of the competitive telecoms market in spain , decided to change the management team in order to bring in fresh ideas and an executive team capable of relaunching its as a serious contender and thereby increasing company value .
as of the end of march , its ' new ceo joined the company bringing with him a wealth of experience in the telecoms sector both in spain and north america .
since this time , the new ceo has put in place a new executive team consisting of a new cfo and coo as well as director of sales . these key positions have been filled with seasoned veterans from the telecoms and consulting areas which amongst these for bring over 80 years related work experience to the project .
in addition , the focus of the company is being changed from being a regionally focused reseller of services to an integrated telecommunications provider focused on the competitive packaging of services to specific market segments nationwide . some of these services will be resold and others will be developed by its , installed , maintained and supported by its , thus providing a differentiated advantage with respect to its traditional competitors . some of these services will be innovative services not yet offered in spain . another element to maximize the effectiveness of this new positioning is that the head office has been moved to madrid , spain ' s telecoms center .
the new its is positioning is focused on ensuring that every dollar of capital employed has a satisfactory return from its shareholders . as such , its is :
1 ) building very little " owned " infrastructure for commodity services , utilizing and integrating the vast amount of underutilized infrastructure of other existing operators .
2 ) investing in technologically innovative infrastructures and services .
3 ) investing in optimising its commercial dimensions .
the company has an excellent list of blue chip distribution partners , such as : corte ingles , respol ( petrol stations ) and carrefour ( 220 stores ) .
the cards are distributed at over 2000 outlets in spain , including 1 , 000 post offices .
the company has pending contracts with a u . s . military base in spain , 15 adventure and marine parks , and a large chain of convenience stores throughout spain .
