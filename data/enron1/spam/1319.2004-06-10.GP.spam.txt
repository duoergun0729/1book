this one appears tame , smith said ,
but could be dangerous because wild animals are unpredictable . people should not
approach it , nor should they run away from the animal since that could provoke a
chase . the best thing to do is ignore it , keep away from it and call the
authorities , he g to tales circulating the wooded neighborhood off , the animal
walked up to a man as he was swinging his toddler in the back yard . the cat is
said to have lunged at the child . as the story goes , the man fended it off with
a chair , his wife grabbed their child , and they ran into the house . the cat sat
on their back deck for a while looking in , just like at the in another tale on a
different street , a teenage baby sitter was at the backyard pool with an
8 - year - old boy and his cousin . the cat sneaked up on them from behind , and she
jumped into the pool with the boy . they swam to the other side , but it followed
them . they all ran into the house , and the cat sat looking in the door .
