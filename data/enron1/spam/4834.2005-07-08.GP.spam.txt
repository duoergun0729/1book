dear sir ,
my name is basheer mohammed said bsharat ( jnr ) and i am a 24 yrs old
jordain on exile in dubai , uae . i write you because i need urgent help .
my father is late basheer mohammed said bsharat who before his death
was a major oil merchant in my country jordan .
i believe my father was murdered by his jealous brothers who at the
moment are after my life too . i own a trust fund which my father
opened for me in one of the big arab banks in jordan but i cannot
access thisfund because i am not old enough yet .
i need an older person to pose as my guardian so that i can collect
this fund before my uncles see me and make me sign documents that i
do not want to sign .
i will disclose the bank , account details and amount to anyone who can
help me secure the release of this fund . it is all that i have left .
i will send my positive identification i . e my international
passport copy and drivers license to prove that i am who i say i am .
i await your positive response .
