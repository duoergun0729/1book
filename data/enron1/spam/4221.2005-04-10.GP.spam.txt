there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that : )
about the company :
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair . they are
mostly men , but also a substantial number of women . most of that 60 - milloin wish
they had it back . gulf biomedical corporation ( gbic ) has a breakthrough product
that will help them . no , it will really help them .
there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing ,
until you read the fine print . the fine print says , " this doesn ' t work for
everybody . " it says , " results may take four months or more to appear . " it says ,
" beware of the side effects . " it says , " a long term contract is required . "
gbic has hairmagict . there is no fine print . hairmagict says , plain and simple :
" hairmagict grows hair . easily . painlessly . inexpensively - for less than $ 2 a
day . results in 4 weeks , or your money back . "

the product :
the product is hairmagictand it grows hair . no , it really grows hair . how
important is that ?
an estimated 60 million american men and women ( yes , women too ) are losing - or
have already lost - their hair . most of them would give anything to have it
back . people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really
don ' t . funny ? sure , if you have a full head of hair . if you don ' t , you would
probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your
head .
that ' s what the experts call a " market ! "
now , you ' ve seen all the ads . they are full of hair - growing promises , plus
warnings that their product doesn ' t work for everybody , and beware of the side
effects . one promises the buyer will see results , if any , in four months . all of
them cost a veritable fortune .
now , finally , there ' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair , and
hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less , or give you a 100 %
refund . and , incredibly , hairmagictsells for less than $ 2 a day .
