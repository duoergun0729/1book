i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan
i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced .
our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go
i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service .
the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them .
a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us .
death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep .
rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time .
listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune .
getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail .
the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication .
our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .
